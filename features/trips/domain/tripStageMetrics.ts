/**
 * Stage Metrics Engine — pure domain service. Consumes only the Timeline
 * (Phase 3) and the trip row (for a completedAt fallback); knows nothing
 * about React, queries, or screens. Derives durations on every call rather
 * than persisting them — the timeline stays the source of truth until one
 * of expensive reporting / very large datasets / SLA history / billing /
 * KPI snapshots actually requires a stored snapshot.
 *
 * Works for active trips: a duration whose start anchor exists but whose
 * end anchor doesn't yet is reported with `isRunning: true`, computed
 * against `nowMs`. Because each duration's end anchor is the next
 * duration's start anchor, at most one duration is ever running at a time
 * for a given trip — no separate "what's the current stage" lookup needed.
 *
 * v1 scope, deliberately not handled (same class of question the user
 * raised when postponing analytics): repeated geofence entry/exit (e.g. a
 * driver leaves pickup and comes back) uses the FIRST occurrence of each
 * event type as its anchor. Revisit if that undercounts dwell time in
 * practice.
