/**
 * Translates Operational Alerts into plain, action-oriented driver copy.
 * Deliberately NOT in features/trips/domain — that layer computes the truth
 * (rules, severities, thresholds), this is copy for one specific audience.
 * Drivers don't see alert titles like "Vehicle behind schedule" or "Pickup
 * dwell exceeded" (that's dispatch language); they see one line telling
 * them what's happening and what to do about it — never back-office detail
 * (queue position, who's been notified) the platform doesn't actually track.
 *
 * Only a subset of alert ids are translated here. Untranslated ids
 * (acceptance_delayed, transit_unusually_long) aren't actionable from where
 * the driver already is in the flow, so they're intentionally silent.
