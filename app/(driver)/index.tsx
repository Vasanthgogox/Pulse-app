/**
 * A7.3 — Driver Home entry point, now a routing decision rather than a
 * direct re-export.
 *
 * Legacy DriverHomeScreen (dispatcher-oriented: Online/Offline via
 * drivers.status, DriverTripFlowCard for an active trip) stays completely
 * unmodified and is still what renders for:
 *   - any driver whose participation isn't DCO-eligible (employed/invited)
 *   - a DCO-eligible driver who currently has an active trip (unavailable)
 *   - while participation/availability are still loading (fail safe to the
 *     existing behavior rather than flash the new surface incorrectly)
 *
 * DriverAvailableScreen (new, A7.2-approved) renders only for a DCO-eligible
 * driver who is currently available (is_driver_available() === true).
 *
 * Participation is fetched locally here (not via a shared hook) rather than
 * touching features/reach/screens/DriverStoriesScreen.tsx's own inline
 * fetch of the same data -- Marketplace/Reach discovery code is explicitly
 * out of scope for A7.3.
