-- Incident: DB Unhealthy, restart did not recover, kept flipping Unhealthy.
-- Root causes fixed here (see docs/DB_PERFORMANCE_HARDENING_CHECKLIST.md for background):
--   1. get_trips_for_org / market_indents_for_org: expensive CTEs/joins evaluated
--      for the WHOLE table before the org filter (or membership guard) narrows rows.
--      Rewritten to filter by organization_id up front so the planner can use the
--      existing organization_id indexes instead of scanning + joining every row.
--   2. authenticator role's idle_in_transaction_session_timeout (60s) and
--      statement_timeout (45s) were wide enough for these slow RPCs to pile up
--      connections during load instead of failing fast. Tightened.
--   3. Cron jobs (log-watcher-health every 1 min, log-watcher-main every 1 min,
--      detect-cron-startup-timeout-incident every 2 min, cron-health-alert /
--      reach_campaigns_pace every 10 min, ops_capture_slow_queries hourly,
--      monitor-watchdog every 15 min) were firing every 1-2 minutes and
--      themselves timing out ("job startup timeout") while Postgres was
--      saturated, adding load on top of the outage instead of just observing it.
--      Staggered/throttled so health-monitoring cron doesn't compete with
--      recovery when the instance is already under pressure.
