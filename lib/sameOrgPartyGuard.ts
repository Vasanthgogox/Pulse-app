/**
 * Service-layer backstop: an organization must not create an offline client or
 * supplier that represents an ACTIVE member of that same organization.
 *
 * Why this exists
 * ---------------
 * `get_invitee_by_phone` / `get_invitees_by_phones` hide same-org active members
 * from invitee lookup, so the "FOUND ON PLATFORM" card can no longer offer a
 * colleague as a connectable org. But the "Add as offline instead" path skips
 * that lookup entirely and inserts straight into `clients` / `suppliers`, where
 * RLS (`is_org_member(organization_id)`) passes precisely because it IS your own
 * org. This closes that path.
 *
 * IMPORTANT — this is NOT database-level enforcement.
 * `clients` and `suppliers` both grant INSERT to the `authenticated` role, so a
 * direct PostgREST call bypasses this check entirely. True DB enforcement would
 * need a stable person/user foreign key on those tables; matching on phone in a
 * trigger is not viable because phone is not a unique identity in this system
 * (verified: two distinct profiles share one number, and many active members
 * have no phone at all). That schema change is deliberately out of scope here.
 *
 * Phone matching reuses `normalizePhoneForInviteeLookup` — the same canonical
 * last-10-digit form the backend RPCs use — so this never becomes a second,
 * divergent phone-matching implementation.
