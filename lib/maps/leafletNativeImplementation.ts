/**
 * Environment-selected native LeafletMap implementation.
 *
 * The `require` calls here are deliberate and are the ONLY ones for map
 * selection in the codebase. They must stay lazy: a static `import` would
 * evaluate both modules, and each throws at import time in the environment it
 * does not belong to. `import()` is not usable either — it is async, and the
 * consumer resolves the component synchronously during render.
